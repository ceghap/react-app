# React APP

This is just a template of react app build without Create React App generator. Contains combination of Babel & Webpack.  
It is created for me to learn webpack & react.  
The real motive is to make sure I understand everything that is happening under the hood instead of just relying on the generator to do everything for me.

## How to start?

- For development run `npm run dev`
- For production run `npm run build`
